# Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch

Welcome to the Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch repository! Here, you'll find implementations of various machine learning algorithms written from scratch in Python. These implementations serve as educational resources for understanding the fundamental concepts behind popular machine learning techniques.

## Overview

Machine learning algorithms are powerful tools for extracting patterns and insights from data. While libraries like scikit-learn and TensorFlow offer efficient implementations of these algorithms, understanding their inner workings is crucial for mastery and innovation in the field of machine learning. In this repository, we provide transparent, step-by-step implementations of several key algorithms, enabling you to dive deep into their mechanics and principles.

## Contents

The repository includes implementations of the following machine learning algorithms:

1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
4. Decision Trees
5. Random Forests
6. K-Means Clustering
3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
7. Support Vector Machines (SVM) #Comming soon
8. Naive Bayes
9. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) #Comming soon
10. Neural Networks (Multilayer Perceptron) #Comming soon

Each algorithm is implemented in Python, accompanied by detailed explanations and comments to aid comprehension and learning.

## How to Use

To explore the implementations and experiment with the algorithms, simply clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MIDHUNGRAJ/Machine_Learning_From_Scratch.git
```
After cloning the repository, navigate to the directory containing the algorithm of interest using the command line or file explorer. Once inside the directory, you can execute the Python script associated with the algorithm. Feel free to modify the code, tweak parameters, or test the algorithms with your own datasets to deepen your understanding.
